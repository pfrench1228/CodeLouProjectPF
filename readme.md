  I have created a website for my significant other's brother who owns a small business back home! He owns a small market store where they sell Kentucky Proud products and local farm meat and produce.  I wanted to have a dynamic navigation menu, picture roller, contact form, and excellently styled webiste.  Google chrome and mobile view through Apple's safari has worked perfectly for viewing my website.
  
  1) I have created a dynamic website with a number of media queries which adjust the header, main content, and footer.  
  2) I have utilized flex boxes to accomplish adjusting the main header, the main nav, main content, and footer with the media queries.  
  3) To adjust the hamburger menu/main-nav, I used javascript with "onclick" to dynamically make the main nav appear and disappear with styles.  I accomplished this by calling out     a function with the the DOM property classlist to add or remove CSS styles.  The hamburger menu only appears on screen sizes less than 650px.
  4) I also added a picture roller feature by using javascript and "onclick".  Functions were given arguments to either roll forward or roll backward through the pictures             described in my picture array.
  5) I created an original CSS animation to style the border of the 2 ul items in the main content.  This feature enables on screen sizes larger than 650px.

 Notes: 
    1) At this time, the contact form is not complete.  It is styled, but there is no associated javascript.
